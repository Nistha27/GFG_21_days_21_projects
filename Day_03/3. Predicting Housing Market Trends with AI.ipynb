    "# Project 3: House Price Prediction (Regression) 🏠\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Objective:** To build a regression model that accurately predicts the sale price of houses based on a large number of features. This project will cover the complete machine learning workflow, from deep EDA to advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts We'll Cover:\n",
    "1.  **Regression vs. Classification:** Understanding the goal of predicting a continuous value.\n",
    "2.  **Target Variable Analysis:** Analyzing the distribution of `SalePrice` and applying transformations (log transform).\n",
    "3.  **Advanced Data Preprocessing:** Implementing robust strategies for handling missing values in both numerical and categorical features.\n",
    "4.  **Feature Engineering:** Creating new, powerful features from the existing data to improve model performance.\n",
    "5.  **Categorical Encoding:** Differentiating between and applying Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.\n",
    "6.  **Model Building:** Training and comparing a simple baseline model (Linear Regression) with an advanced model (XGBoost).\n",
    "7.  **Model Evaluation:** Understanding and using key regression metrics (RMSE, MAE, R-squared)."

    "XGBoost is a highly efficient and popular gradient boosting algorithm. It's an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly flexible, portable, and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "XGBoost builds trees sequentially. Each new tree attempts to correct the errors made by the previous trees. The predictions from all the trees are then summed up to get the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features and Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Regularization:** Includes L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "2. **Handling Missing Values:** Has a built-in mechanism to handle missing values.\n",
    "3. **Tree Pruning:** Supports 'depth-first' and 'breadth-first' tree growth and pruning, which can improve performance and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "4. **Parallel Processing:** Designed to be highly parallelizable, making it faster than traditional gradient boosting implementations.\n",
    "5. **Flexibility:** Supports various objective functions and evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost is known for its performance on structured data and is often a top choice in machine learning competitions. However, it can be more complex to tune and understand compared to simpler models like Linear Regression."

    "3.  Implemented a **robust preprocessing strategy**, handling various types of missing data and encoding categorical features correctly.\n",
